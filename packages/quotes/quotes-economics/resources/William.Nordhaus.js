    quote: 'We have to be grown-ups, I think [when discussing the payment of funds today to prevent  climate harm which may be decades in the future]. There are lots of things we do where the investments come way, way in the future. Educating 4-year-olds . . . that\'s an investment that goes way into the future as well.'

    quote: 'Putting a low price on valuable environmental resources is a phenomenon that pervades modern society. Agricultural water is not scarce in California; it is underpriced. Flights are stacked up on runways because takeoffs and landings are underpriced. People wait for hours in traffic jams because road use is unpriced. People die premature deaths from small sulfur particles in the air because air pollution is underpriced. And the most perilous of all environmental problems, climate change, is taking place because virtually every country puts a price of zero on  carbon dioxide emissions.'

    quote: 'My own view is that there basically is no alternative to a market solution. The reason is, if you look around, who are we talking about that’s going to solve the problem: it’s you and me. There are billions of individuals, millions of firms, thousands of governments, hundreds of nations, and for them to take action, they’re going to have to have incentives. The kind of incentives we’re talking about; they’re not speeches - we can sermonize all day - but the incentives of market prices. [This requires us to] raise the prices of goods and services that are carbon intensive, and to lower the ones that are less carbon intensive.'

    quote: 'When I talk to people about how to design a carbon price, I think the model is  British Columbia. You raise electricity prices by $100 a year, but then the government gives back a dividend that lowers internet prices by $100 year. In real terms, you’re raising the price of  carbon goods but lowering the prices of non-carbon-intensive goods.'
