The sun is gradually getting hotter and bigger, and over time, even in the absence of global warming — the man-made stuff — the sun will expand and it will overheat the earth.  My guess is probably... there is only several hundred million years left....  Basically, if it took an extra 10% longer for conscious life to evolve on earth, it wouldn\'t evolve at all, because it would have been incinerated by the sun. ... It appears that consciousness is a very rare and precious thing, and we should take whatever steps we can to preserve the light of consciousness, and the window has been open; only now after four and a half billion years is that window open, that\'s a long time to wait ... I\'m pretty optimistic by nature, but there\'s some chance that window will not be open for long, I think we should become a multi-planet civilization while that window is open, and if we do the I think probable outcome for Earth is even better, because then you know Mars could help Earth one day.

    quote: 'Sending large numbers of people to explore and settle Mars in the decades ahead isn\'t inevitable, but it is entirely possible. The biggest challenge isn\'t the engineering and spacecraft, however difficult they may be. Instead, it\'s making sure that a sustained Mars campaign proceeds as a national priority, and that will happen only if the American people are behind it. We have the opportunity now to make this happen. We might not be so fortunate in the future.'

    quote: 'So, I think the best analogy for rocket engineers, if you want to create complicated software, you can\'t run as an integrated whole, or run on the computer it\'s intended to run on, but, first time you run it, it has to run with no bugs. That\'s the essence of it. So ... we missed the mark there.'
