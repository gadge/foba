So I think happiness is contentment but it doesn\'t mean you have to have wealth. But all individuals are different. Some of us just wouldn\'t be satisfied with just carrying out a routine job and being happy. Yet I envied those people. I had a brother who I really envied because he was a mailman. But he\'s the one that had all the fun. He had himself a trailer, and he used to go out and go fishing, and he didn\'t worry about payrolls and stories and picture grosses or anything. And he was the happy one. I always said, "He\'s the smart Disney."' },
