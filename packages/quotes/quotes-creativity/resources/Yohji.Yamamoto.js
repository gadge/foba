    quote: 'Generally speaking, I am not interested in the future and don\'t believe in it. First, I guess it is true that I don\'t trust the future, but, more to the point, I don\'t even trust the "myself" of tomorrow, nor, for that matter, of the day after. Basically, all I know, and all I am capable of understanding, is the "me" that is here, now, the "me" that has dragged his past with him to this point.'

    quote: 'I think perfection is ugly. Somewhere in the things humans make, I want to see scars, failure, disorder, distortion. If I can feel those things in works by others, then I like them.'

    quote: 'In order to create an image almost similar to that of a pencil case standing up and walking, I try to eliminate all excess by cutting. I have the feeling that this process (of "cutting off") is linked in some way to "elegance". Elegance and so-called "eliminating excess", or the beauty that remains after excess has beeen eliminated...'

But in my work, in the clothes I create, I\'m actually telling people that I\'m here. So, I guess I\'m disturbing them, after all.'
