  quote: 'I think so many of the objects we\'re surrounded by seem trivial. And I think that\'s because they\'re either trying to make a statement or trying to be overtly different. What we were trying to do was have a very honest approach and an exploration of materials and surface treatment. So much of what we try to do is get to a point where the solution seems inevitable: you know, you think "of course it\'s that way, why would it be any other way?" It looks so obvious, but that sense of inevitability in the solution is really hard to achieve.'

In other words, when our tools are broken, we feel broken. And when somebody fixes one, we feel a tiny bit more whole.'

I already knew that very soon I would thrill at everything American, love everything American, perhaps blindly, but fervently and forever. I still remember how thrilled I was at the sight of the flag.  After all these years, every time I see the Stars and Stripes in the breeze, I get the same emotional feeling. Aesthetically speaking, it is perfect. One of the outstanding "designs" of all times. It may be that a nation gets the flag it deserves.'

This parallel universe has influenced me perhaps even more than the real world or the physical world. Because when I think of certain things, like a beautiful woman, its most likely someone I saw on film... these are things I\'ve been taking from film or television and applying it to real life.'
